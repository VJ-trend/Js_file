// Hoisting 

//Hoisting is a JavaScript mechanism where variables and function declarations 
//are moved to the top of their containing scope during the compilation phase,
// regardless of where they're declared in the code. 


// GEC

//The Global Execution Context (GEC) is the environment in which JavaScript code is executed globally.
// It consists of two phases: the creation phase, where variables and functions are hoisted and memory is allocated,
// and the execution phase, where the code is actually run.


//callstack 

//The call stack is a data structure used by the JavaScript engine to manage the execution context of function calls. 
//It keeps track of the order in which functions are called and executed.

//callstack works in LIFO method = Last In First Out.
