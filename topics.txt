COPY BY VALUE :

Copy by value involves creating a duplicate of the original data, independent of the original. 
Any changes made to the duplicate do not affect the original data.


COPY BY REFERENCE :

Copy by reference" involves creating a new reference to the original data, rather than duplicating it. 
Any modifications made through one reference affect the original data and are visible through all references
pointing to it.
