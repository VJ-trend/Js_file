// The global scope refers to the area of a program where variables and functions are accessible from anywhere in the code.
// Variables declared outside of any function or block have global scope. They can be accessed and modified from any part of the code, 
//including within functions or block

// var globalVar = "I'm  good";
// function foo() {
//     console.log(globalVar);  //Can access globalVar
// }
// foo(); 
// Outputs: I'm  good‚Äù



//Block scope or Local:
//Block scope in JavaScript refers to the visibility and accessibility of variables or functions within a specific block,
// typically delimited by curly braces {} or within a function. 
//Variables declared inside a function or block have local scope and are only accessible within that function or block, 
//providing encapsulation and preventing unintended variable modifications from outside the scope.
